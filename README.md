Source code for my master thesis, Predicting the Difficulty of Games based on Their Reviews.

PCMethod is the implementation of ["Learning from Crowds and Expert"](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/WS/AAAIW12/paper/viewFile/5257/5610).
Dataset is from [Amazon Review Dataset](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/). We have two labels, one is 'difficulty sentence' label that we acquire from crowdsourcing service, and the main label is crawled from gamefaqs.com
